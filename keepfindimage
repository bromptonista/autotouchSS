-- example 1:
-- the function required by keepFindingImage must be like "function(locations)", 
-- then you can use the locations inside that function.

-- ATTENTION: execute f2 will return a new function accepts the locations table which is the function will be execute in keepFindingImage
-- That's different with f1, the merit of f2 is that you can pass some extra parameters to the function(locations).
